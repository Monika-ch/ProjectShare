export const PROMPT_RESPONSE = `That's great! Here are some tips that might help you in your career growth and learning as a software developer:

1. **Master the Basics**: Make sure you have a solid understanding of data structures, algorithms, and system design. These are fundamental to most software development roles.

2. **Learn a Framework**: Once you're comfortable with a programming language, learn a popular framework in that language. For example, if you're a Python developer, you might want to learn Django or Flask.

3. **Work on Projects**: Building your own projects is a great way to learn and demonstrate your skills. This could be anything from a personal website to a mobile app.

4. **Read Code**: Reading other people's code can help you understand different ways to solve problems and learn best practices.

5. **Contribute to Open Source**: This can help you gain practical experience, learn from others, and make connections in the industry.

6. **Networking**: Attend meetups, conferences, and workshops. Networking can open up opportunities and help you learn from others' experiences.

7. **Continuous Learning**: Technology evolves rapidly. Make learning new technologies, tools, and methods an ongoing process.

8. **Soft Skills**: Communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills are just as important as technical skills in software development.

Remember, everyone's journey is unique, and there's no one-size-fits-all approach to success in software development. Find what works best for you, and don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone. Good luck! ðŸ˜Š`;
